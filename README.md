##MatLab-files
============

MatLab files written for the macroeconomics modeling course.

_monte carlo PS4 macro 3.m_ and _IRF PS4 macro.m_ set up a Real Business Cycle model and Impulse Response Functions (IRFs), that show how variables react to a productivity shock (picture added as RIF.jpg).

_DMP macro ps5.m_ presents a Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides search model and calculates a Beveridge curve (mathematical description of the labour market). Untitled.jpg shows this beveridge curve and two job supply curves (one initial one, a second after a productivity shock).

_macro ps3-2.nb_ is a simple Mathematica program that calculates some modelling values that I decided to add under this folder.
